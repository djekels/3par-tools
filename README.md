3par-tools
==========

(Legacy) Simple scripts written to assist in tasks for administrating and migrating 3PAR storage arrays.

These scripts at one point in time were useful in working with a 3PAR array. One of the scripts exports all
the host objects to make migrations simpler. The other is a super basic performance profiler. Since I no longer
work with 3par arrays, these scripts are purely educational. I'm putting them in this repo in the hopes that they
may provide use to somebody someday.
